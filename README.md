# Speech Recognition System for Ten Distinct Words

This project involves developing a speech recognition system capable of identifying ten distinct spoken words using neural network models. The system utilizes both a pre-trained ResNet-18 model and a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built from scratch with PyTorch. The project covers dataset creation, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

All code is located in the `src` folder. The report, available in both LaTeX and PDF formats, is in the `report` folder.
